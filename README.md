ODYM   -   Open Dynamic Material Systems Model

__Please note that ODYM is still in its inception phase. A proper release and with it a first comprehensive documentation is scheduled for mid 2018.__

The ODYM model framework can best be described as a system dynamics model of biophysical stock-flow relations in socioeconomic metabolism. The model does not adhere to a specific economic paradigm but is founded on mass balance, market clearance, technical constraints, and physical resource availability. Within the solution space spanned by the biophysical constraints the model framework applies a variety of modules to determine likely, plausible, and optimal input- and output flows of ores, materials, products, waste, and scrap.

The novel features of ODYM include:
•	System variables (stocks and flows) can have any number of aspects (time, age-cohort, region, product, component, material, element, …)
•	The software automatically matches the different dimensions during computations. No manual re-indexing of tables and arrays will be necessary. 
•	The user only specifies those aspects that are relevant for the model. The software handles the data storage and matching of the indices used.
•	The software checks whether a consistent classification is used all across the model
•	Flexibility regarding different data formats (table and list) and subsets of classifications used (only certain years or chemical elements, for example)
•	Representation of system variables and parameters as objects, general data structures serve as interfaces to a wide spectrum of modules for stock-driven modelling, waste cascade optimisation, etc, some of which yet have to be developed.

__Please note that ODYM is still in its inception phase. A proper release and with it a first comprehensive documentation is scheduled for mid 2018.__
